# Printer
Uses stacks and queues to organize printer users

Just a mini "project" to get me experienced with implementing stacks and queues.
I used a queue to organize the people using the printer and a stack to organize the files that each individual wants to print. The program is also object oriented with nested classes.
The queue was made with a linked list and the stack was just the standard library std::stack
I think I could have done the object oriented side better but didn't want to spend time working more on the project since I intended for it to be pretty small in size. 

Overall a great learning tool to implement stacks and queues and also another good learning tool to help me get more comfortable with OOP.
